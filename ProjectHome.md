ozex is an opensource Ozi Explorer (navigation part) replacement.

It is based on cross-platform swampex library, so you can build your
own navigation system for any platform.

If you was unable to build the project, or want to participate in development, or something else -
you can contact me: dn.smelov at gmail com.

How to build:

1. Read about dependencies for swampex and install them:
http://code.google.com/p/swampex/wiki/ListOfDependencies

2. Install wxwidgets library for your platform.

3. Try to build the project :)

4. In case of success please read:
